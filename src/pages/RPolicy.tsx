            This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or
            seek a refund for a product / service that you have purchased
            through the Platform. Under this policy:
          </p>

          <p>
            Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made 1 days
            of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be
            entertained if the orders have been communicated to such sellers /
            merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the
            process of shipping them, or the product is out for delivery. In
            such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.
          </p>

          <p>
            LAGISHETTY UDAY KUMAR does not accept cancellation requests for
            perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, the refund /
            replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality of
            the product delivered is not good.
          </p>

          <p>
            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to
            our customer service team. The request would be entertained once the
            seller/ merchant listed on the Platform, has checked and determined
            the same at its own end. This should be reported within 1 days of
            receipt of products. In case you feel that the product received is
            not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring
            it to the notice of our customer service within 1 days of receiving
            the product. The customer service team after looking into your
            complaint will take an appropriate decision.
          </p>

          <p>
            In case of complaints regarding the products that come with a
            warranty from the manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
          </p>

          <p>
            In case of any refunds approved by LAGISHETTY UDAY KUMAR, it will
            take 1 days for the refund to be processed to you.
